EXAMPLE INTERACTIVE SESSION
============================

This is an example of how to use the interactive mode:

python3 late_interest_engine.py --interactive

Example inputs:

CAPITAL CALLS:
--------------
Capital Call #1:
  Due date: 1/15/22
  Call percentage: 10

Capital Call #2:
  Due date: 6/15/22
  Call percentage: 15

Capital Call #3:
  Due date: 12/15/22
  Call percentage: 20

Then type: done


PARTNERS:
---------
Partner #1 (Existing LP):
  Partner name: ABC Partners
  Commitment: 5m
  Issue date: [Enter for default]
  Close number: 1

Partner #2 (Existing LP):
  Partner name: XYZ Capital
  Commitment: 10m
  Issue date: [Enter for default]
  Close number: 1

Partner #3 (New LP at subsequent close):
  Partner name: New Investor LLC
  Commitment: 3m
  Issue date: 7/1/22
  Close number: 2

Then type: done

The system will:
1. Calculate late interest from New Investor LLC (who missed calls 1 & 2)
2. Allocate that late interest pro-rata to existing LPs (ABC Partners & XYZ Capital)
3. Show detailed breakdown by capital call
4. Display final summary
